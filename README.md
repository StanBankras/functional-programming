# Functional Programming
_Cleaning raw survey data so it becomes usable_

During the functional programming course @CMDA-TT, the goal is to write code that cleans data with functional patterns. One of the most important things however is to describe the used patterns and show my understand and progress in the subject.

## Usage
If you are cleaning survey data, you might be able to use this project as a template to start writing functional patterns right away. There are some requirements to running this project, which will be explained in the 'Installation' part of the readme.

### What can this project be used for?
If you have JSON data readily available of any kind of survey, this project allows you to easily read that JSON with Javascript and start writing functional patterns to clean that data up right away.
